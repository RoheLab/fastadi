`fastadi` implements the `AdaptiveImpute` matrix completion algorithm. `fastadi` is a self-tuning alternative to algorithms such as `SoftImpute` (implemented in the [`softImpute`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=softImpute) package), truncated SVD, maximum margin matrix factorization, and weighted regularized matrix factorization (implemented in the [`rsparse`](https://github.com/rexyai/rsparse) package). In simulations `fastadi` often outperforms `softImpute` by a small margin.

You may find `fastadi` useful if you are developing embeddings for sparsely observed data, if you are working in natural language processing, or building a recommendation system.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RoheLab/fastadi")
```

## Example usage

Here we embed users and items in the MovieLens 100K dataset.

```{r}
library(fastadi)

mf <- adaptive_impute(ml100k, rank = 3L, max_iter = 5L)
```

```{r}
mf
```

Note that the vignettes are currently scratch work for reference by the developers and are not yet ready for general consumption.
