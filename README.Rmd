`fastadi` implements the `AdaptiveImpute` matrix completion algorithm of [2, 1]. `fastadi` is a self-tuning alternative to algorithms such as `SoftImpute` (implemented in the [`softImpute`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=softImpute) package), truncated SVD, maximum margin matrix factorization, and weighted regularized matrix factorization (implemented in the [`rsparse`](https://github.com/rexyai/rsparse) package). In simulations `fastadi` often outperforms `softImpute` by a small margin.

You may find `fastadi` useful if you are developing embeddings for sparsely observed data, if you are working in natural language processing, or building a recommendation system.

At the moment `fastadi` is a relatively low-level package, performing matrix factorization and returning a low rank approximation `U D V'` of an original data matrix. It is up to you to manipulate the matrices `U`, `D` and `V` appropriately for your application; if you are interested in a higher level interface for a task you are working on, please file an issue!

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
