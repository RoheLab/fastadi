Description: Implements the AdaptiveImpute matrix completion
    algorithm of 'Intelligent Initialization and Adaptive Thresholding for
    Iterative Matrix Completion',
    <https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10618600.2018.1518238>.
    AdaptiveImpute is useful for embedding sparsely observed matrices,
    often out performs competing matrix completion algorithms, and
    self-tunes its hyperparameter, making usage easy.
